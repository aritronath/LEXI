Title: LEXI: lncRNA expression imputation
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Aritro Nath
Maintainer: Aritro Nath <aritronath@gmail.com>
Description: LEXI imputes expression profile of an lncRNA of interest from 
    protein coding gene expression data. The statistical model for imputing 
    lncRNA expression is generated using a training proteing coding and lncRNA
    expression dataset, and applied on a test protein coding dataset to obtain
    profile of lncRNA of interest. 
    This package includes functions to obtain matched training and test 
    protein coding gene matrices, filtering lncRNA datasets based on percetage
    of samples with positive expression of lncRNA, cross-validations to obtain
    imputation accucacy and imputation function to get lncRNA profile.
